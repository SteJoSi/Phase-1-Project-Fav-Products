# Cosmo x Beauty

## Description 
**Cosmo x Beauty** is an interactive website that will allow my customers to purchase my favorite hair, skin, make-up, and bath products. The idea for this project came about because I am going on 6 years as being a hairdresser and I am not only passionate about all things hair care, but all beauty related items. I have gone through intense product knowledge training to allow me to tell clients what works, what doesn't work and why. I have gone through many trial and errors with hundreds of products and my clients have always trusted my input on products, so I thought I would create a website to include my favorite products.  

## Installation
Copy and paste this [url](https://github.com/SteJoSi/Phase-1-Project-Fav-Products.git) into your browser. In your terminal, make sure you are in the correct directory and the proper folder that you would like to clone this repository in. Once done, fork and clone the **SSH key** into your terminal using the command `git clone (url).` And finally, use the command `code .` to open the file in your prefered code editor.
